**An open methodology for measuring AI-generated software production readiness.**

The Sigil Benchmark measures whether AI-generated code can safely face production traffic, real users, and adversarial conditions. It's the production-readiness layer of AI codegen evaluation — complementary to capability benchmarks like [HELM](https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/), [SWE-bench](https://www.swebench.com/), [HumanEval](https://github.com/openai/human-eval), and [MLE-bench](https://github.com/openai/mle-bench).

While other benchmarks measure *what AI tools can produce*, the **Production Readiness Score (PRS)** measures *whether that output is safe to ship*.

> **Project status:** This is an early open-source release. The methodology is under active development. Governance is currently informal (project maintainers). The intent is to transition to an independent governing body as the project matures; see [Governance](#governance) below.

## What This Measures

PRS evaluates AI-generated codebases across five dimensions:

| Dimension | Weight | What it measures |
|---|---|---|
| **Security** | 25% | Static analysis, CVEs, OWASP ASVS, secret management, TLS |
| **Production Readiness Ops** | 25% | Error handling, observability, health checks, DB pooling, time correctness |
| **Scalability** | 20% | Load tests, async processing, statelessness, container readiness, indexing |
| **Compliance** | 20% | GDPR, SOC2 baseline, audit logging, access controls (3-tier functional scoring) |
| **Cost Efficiency** | 10% | Vendor lock-in, multi-cloud, OSS ratio, pricing predictability |

50 sub-components total. Per-task weight templates allow domain-specific re-weighting (admin tools de-emphasize scalability, marketplaces emphasize compliance, etc.).

Full methodology: **[METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md)** (v0.4, designed for top-venue peer review).

## Why It Exists

AI codegen tools are rapidly increasing in capability but vary enormously in production output quality. There is currently **no widely-adopted benchmark** for whether AI-generated code is actually safe to ship. Procurement teams, regulators, journalists, and developers need a transparent, methodologically rigorous reference.

The Sigil Benchmark aims to be one open contribution to that gap — open methodology, open code, open data. We hope it can eventually be governed by an independent body; see [Governance](#governance).

## Status

**v0 scaffold** — this is an early, working reference implementation. Not yet ready for publication as an official Sigil Index cycle.

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| 5-dimension methodology (v0.4) | ✅ Complete, peer-review grade |
| Benchmark harness (Python) | ✅ Working |
| Tool adapters (Claude Code, Anthropic API, OpenAI API, manual) | ✅ Working |
| 32 of 50 sub-components implemented | ✅ Static analysis |
| 18 deployment-dependent sub-components | 🚧 Require live deployment + probes |
| Statistical analysis (bootstrap CIs, BH correction, rank stability) | ✅ Working |
| Demo pipeline (`scripts/demo_pipeline.py`) | ✅ Runs end-to-end with mock data |
| Real benchmark cycle (Sigil Index Q1+) | 📋 Not yet run |

A first real preliminary cycle has been recorded against `claude-code` on Task 01 (B2B SaaS portal). See **[LEADERBOARD.md](LEADERBOARD.md)**.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lawrenzho-bit/sigil-benchmark.git
cd sigil-benchmark
pip install -e .

# Run the demo with mock data (no API keys needed)
python scripts/demo_pipeline.py

# Run against Claude Code (requires `claude` CLI authenticated)
python scripts/smoke_claude_code.py
```

Detailed setup: **[docs/getting_started.md](docs/getting_started.md)**.

## Methodology Highlights

- **Dual-mode scoring**: PRS-Autonomous (zero human modification) + PRS-Reviewed (one round of standardized human review). Different AI workflows (Cursor vs Claude Code vs Devin) get fair comparisons.
- **Safety refusal track**: Tools that refuse harmful prompts are rewarded, not penalized.
- **Statistical rigor**: Bootstrap percentile CIs (10,000 resamples), Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction, Cohen's d effect size gates, minimum detectable effect disclosure.
- **AI-Involvement Spectrum**: Tools classified into 6 positions (Suggestive → Augmentative → Conversational → Agentic → End-to-End → Composed). Cross-position comparisons explicitly caveated.
- **Anti-gaming**: 30% held-out test set, annual task rotation, anti-training detection, methodology audit requirements for high-scoring tools.
- **Validity studies**: Test-retest reliability, concurrent validity (vs expert ratings), discriminant validity, longitudinal real-world correlation study.
- **Pre-registration**: Task selection and analysis plan pre-registered on [OSF.io](https://osf.io/) before each cycle.

See **[METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md)** for the full specification.

## Governance

This repository is currently maintained informally by the project's authors. The methodology is published under Apache 2.0 to encourage open use and extension.

**Long-term intent:** As the project matures and the community grows, we plan to transition governance to an independent body (working name: *Sigil Foundation*). That body would:

- Hold the methodology under Apache 2.0
- Convene a Technical Steering Committee with rotating members from academia, industry, and regulatory backgrounds
- Run annual methodology RFC processes
- Coordinate independent audits
- Coordinate the publication of regular benchmark cycles

This is aspirational, not currently in place. Until a formal governing body exists, contributions are reviewed by the project maintainers. If you'd like to help shape the governance structure, open a discussion or reach out.
